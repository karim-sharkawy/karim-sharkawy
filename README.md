## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a math graduate and data scientist passionate about turning theory into real-world impact. I thrive on solving open-ended problems with uncertainty, especially in climate, energy, and research domains. I’m looking to collaborate on research or applied projects involving AI for climate systems, renewable energy optimization, or data-driven modeling of complex systems. I’m currently learning advanced Agile project management techniques, as well as deepening my skills in reinforcement learning and probabilistic modeling.

- 🔬 **Research**: Operator theory, exoplanetary atmospheres, climate modeling
- 🧑‍💻 **Programming**: Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch), MATLAB, Git, Azure
- 🌱 **Interests**: Machine learning, matrix methods in data science, optimization (covex, linear), reinforcement learning, climate tech

## 🚀 Projects

- **Reinforcement Learning for Renewable Energy Grid Optimization**
  Designing RL frameworks for energy allocation in power grids using DQN/PPO & OpenAI Gym.
- **Ensemble Pipeline for Climate Forecasting**  
  Multivariate LSTM & Random Forest ensemble, Bayesian tuning, 99% variance explained.
