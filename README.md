### 👋 Hi, I’m Karim El-Sharkawy

- 🔭 I’m currently working on optimizing power grid design for renewable energy using reinforcement learning, mathematical modeling, and stochastic optimization.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Agile project management techniques, as well as deepening my skills in reinforcement learning, probabilistic modeling, and Korean language.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on research or applied projects involving AI for climate systems, renewable energy optimization, or data-driven modeling of complex systems.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with deploying RL-based energy management systems at scale and integrating uncertainty quantification into operational decision-making.
- 💬 Ask me about applied linear algebra, machine learning with Python, climate informatics, or building optimization frameworks from theory to implementation.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once led a volunteer effort that coordinated daily food distribution for 100+ people during Ramadan, managing logistics and a cross-functional team!
