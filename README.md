# Hi, I'm Karim El-Sharkawy 👋
I’m passionate about building production-grade machine learning systems and scalable data engineering pipelines that solve real-world problems. I enjoy working on end-to-end ML workflows — from raw data and feature engineering to deployment, monitoring, and automation — with a strong focus on MLOps and platform-level engineering.

* 🔬 **Current project**: Designing a full ML Engineering + MLOps pipeline with modular branches for data engineering and model development, using SQL, PySpark, TensorFlow, Docker, and CI/CD to simulate real production ML platform workflows.
* 🧑‍💻 **Interests**: Production ML systems, NLP for social impact, scalable data pipelines, ML infrastructure, system optimization.
* ⚡ **Skills**: Python (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), PySpark, SQL, AzureML, Docker, CI/CD
